# Arduino project
Final project for Experience and Physical Computing class

This is a git repository that contains the readMe file and code for my project. For my final project I chose to make a piano key with Arduino and make a visual representation of piano in p5js. My inspiration was another project related to making a synthesizer using Arduino.
